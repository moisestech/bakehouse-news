# QR Code Generator for Smart Sign Access

## Quick Setup for Mobile Access

### 1. Generate QR Codes
Use any free QR code generator (like qr-code-generator.com) to create QR codes for:

**Main Smart Sign URL:**
```
https://your-domain.com
```

**Direct Carousel View:**
```
https://your-domain.com?view=carousel
```

**Direct Grid View:**
```
https://your-domain.com?view=grid
```

### 2. Print and Place QR Codes
Print QR codes and place them strategically around Bakehouse:

- **Main entrance** - "See what's happening today"
- **Kitchen area** - "Community updates"
- **Studio corridors** - "Artist opportunities"
- **Audrey Love Gallery** - "Current events"
- **Office area** - "Staff announcements"

### 3. Physical Sign Templates

**Small Signs (3x5"):**
```
ðŸ“± Smart Sign
Scan to see what's happening
at Bakehouse today!
```

**Medium Signs (8.5x11"):**
```
ðŸŽ¨ BAKEHOUSE SMART SIGN
Stay connected with your community!

ðŸ“… Events & Openings
ðŸ”§ Facility Updates  
ðŸ’¼ Opportunities
ðŸš¨ Urgent Announcements

ðŸ“± Scan QR code to access
```

### 4. Mobile Optimization
Your current system is already mobile-responsive, but consider:

- **PWA (Progressive Web App)** - Make it installable on phones
- **Push notifications** - For urgent announcements
- **Offline capability** - Cache content for when WiFi is spotty

### 5. Quick Implementation Steps

1. **Generate QR codes** using the URLs above
2. **Print signs** with QR codes
3. **Place strategically** around Bakehouse
4. **Test with 5 residents** - ask them to scan and give feedback
5. **Iterate** based on feedback

### 6. Success Metrics
- **Week 1**: 10+ unique mobile users
- **Week 2**: 25+ unique mobile users  
- **Week 3**: 50+ unique mobile users

This creates the foundation for dependency - once people start checking their phones for updates, you've created a habit that's hard to break.
