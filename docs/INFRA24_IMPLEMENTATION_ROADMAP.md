## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Implementation Details

### Frontend Architecture
```typescript
// Multi-tenant routing
const getTenantFromHost = (host: string) => {
  const subdomain = host.split('.')[0];
  return subdomain === 'infra24' ? null : subdomain;
};

// Theme system
const useTenantTheme = () => {
  const tenant = useTenant();
  return tenant?.theme || defaultTheme;
};
```

### Database Schema
```sql
-- Row-Level Security example
CREATE POLICY "Users can only see their organization's data" ON bookings
  FOR ALL USING (
    organization_id IN (
      SELECT organization_id FROM memberships 
      WHERE user_id = auth.uid()
    )
  );
```

### API Structure
```typescript
// Tenant-aware API routes
export async function GET(request: Request) {
  const tenant = await getTenantFromRequest(request);
  const data = await getBookings(tenant.id);
  return Response.json(data);
}
```

## üîß Development Tools & Workflow

### Local Development
```bash
# Set up development environment
npm install
cp .env.example .env.local
npm run db:seed
npm run dev

# Run tests
npm run test
npm run test:e2e

# Build for production
npm run build
npm run start
```

### Database Management
```bash
# Run migrations
npm run db:migrate

# Seed development data
npm run db:seed

# Reset database
npm run db:reset
```

### Deployment
```bash
# Deploy to staging
npm run deploy:staging

# Deploy to production
npm run deploy:production

# Run health checks
npm run health:check
```
