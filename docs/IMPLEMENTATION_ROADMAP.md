  const { event, data } = await request.json()
  
  if (event === 'booking.created') {
    await createBookingFromCalcom(data)
  }
}

// CRM Sync Processor
export async function processCRMOutbox() {
  const events = await getPendingEvents()
  for (const event of events) {
    await syncToCRM(event)
  }
}
```

### 2. Internal API Endpoints
