## 1. IMMEDIATE ACTIVATION STRATEGY (7-Day Power Play)

### Day 1: Stealth Launch
- **Turn on Smart Sign** with the latest announcements from Christine's email
- **Seed with 3-5 key residents** who are frustrated with current communication
- **Create QR codes** for easy mobile access to the system
- **Post physical signs** around Bakehouse: "See what's happening → Scan QR"

### Day 2-3: Create Dependency
- **Launch daily digest** - email/WhatsApp summary of Smart Sign content
- **Enable RSVPs** for upcoming events (René Morales meet & greet, Open Studios)
- **Show real-time updates** for facility changes (Digital Print Lab reopening)

### Day 4-5: Demonstrate Value
- **Publish first "Attention Report"** showing engagement metrics
- **Highlight missed opportunities** (artists who didn't know about events)
- **Show time savings** (no more email chains, instant updates)

### Day 6-7: Institutional Pressure
- **Send Bakehouse leadership** a "Week 1 Outcomes" deck
- **Include testimonials** from artists using the system
- **Present service agreement** for formal adoption

## 2. POWER LEVERAGE STRATEGIES (24 Ways to Control the Channel)

### A. ADOPTION & DEFAULT-SETTING (Make Smart Sign the Way Things Move)

1. **Become the Canonical Calendar**
   - Publish living events feed (onsite screen + mobile link)
   - Offer one-click "Add to Calendar" for all events
   - Once people rely on your feed, you're the default

2. **Daily/Weekly Digest**
   - Auto-email + WhatsApp/Telegram digest from Smart Sign posts
   - People will depend on it; Bakehouse will feel pressure to "officialize"

3. **Resident Onboarding = Account Creation**
   - New artist orientation includes Smart Sign QR to claim profile
   - Make "How to get visibility here? → Post on Smart Sign" the cultural norm

4. **QR Flyers Everywhere**
   - Label physical doors, studios, bulletin boards with "Post it → Show up here"
   - You become the layer between physical space and attention

### B. DATA & INSIGHT LEVERAGE (Control the Map of Attention)

5. **Monthly Insights Report**
   - Publish "Attention Report" (top posts, attendance RSVPs, engagement heatmaps)
   - Admins will want this—moment they use your numbers in board decks, you're indispensable

6. **RSVP + Check-in System**
   - Every event post can run RSVPs & on-site QR check-in
   - You control attendance lists, follow-ups, and proof of impact (gold for grants)

7. **Directory & Graph**
   - Auto-build resident/org directory from posts (who does what, collaborations graph)
   - When people use your directory to find collaborators, you're the gate

8. **Urgent Alerts**
   - Optional channel for facility/emergency notifications (power outages, closures)
   - When safety relies on your pipe, you've locked in relevance

### C. PROGRAMMING & EDITORIAL (Own the Taste and Curation)

9. **"Curator's Picks" Slots**
   - 3 daily spotlight slots (free at first, later sponsored)
   - Once artists see real lift, priority placement becomes valuable

10. **Thematic Weeks**
    - "Open Studios Week," "Video Art Week," etc.
    - Concentrate attention; sell bundles (placement + social push + digest feature)

11. **Content Standards + Badges**
    - "Verified Resident," "Featured Event," "Family-friendly"
    - Your taxonomy guides what's seen; standards = soft power

### D. MONETIZATION & SPONSORSHIP (Turn Attention into Revenue)

12. **Promoted Announcements**
    - Free basic posts; paid priority for featured placement
    - Keep it tasteful and capped

13. **Resident Boost Packs**
    - $19-49/month includes 2 featured posts, analytics report, 1:1 copy/promo help
    - Easy upsell to artists who want reliable visibility

14. **Local Sponsor Ribbons**
    - "Supported by [local café/print shop]" banner between posts
    - Sell to community businesses; offer them 2 comp posts/month

15. **Marketplace Classifieds**
    - Paid listings for "studio sublets, equipment, gigs" (moderated)
    - The board already exists informally—formalize and capture value

16. **Managed Service Plan (MSP)**
    - Hardware maintenance + content QA + monthly report as flat retainer
    - Offer bronze/silver/gold tiers

### E. INTEGRATION & LOCK-IN (Raise Switching Costs)

17. **Website Embed + Lobby Screen Syndication**
    - Offer simple embed for Bakehouse's site and mirror to multiple screens
    - The more surfaces you power, the harder you are to replace

18. **Cross-posting Bots**
    - Optional push to Instagram stories, Threads, and Slack/Discord
    - You become the "one post → everywhere" tool

19. **API Keys for Partners**
    - Let partner orgs pull filtered feed for their own screens/newsletters
    - Once third parties rely on your API, you're infrastructure

### F. GOVERNANCE & LEGITIMACY (Own the Rules of the Road)

20. **Advisory Council (You Convene It)**
    - 3 residents + 1 staff + you
    - Publish light governance: posting rules, rotation of picks, transparency
    - Legitimacy = leverage

21. **Service Agreement Template (Publicly Ready)**
    - "We already operate with these SLAs and privacy terms"
    - Makes it easy for Bakehouse to rubber-stamp your existing reality

22. **Branding Co-credit**
    - "Smart Sign × Bakehouse Digital Bulletin"
    - Every surface reinforces you as the platform—co-credit locks shared reputation

### G. EXPANSION & REPLICATION (Your Leverage Scales)

23. **Pilot-to-Network Play**
    - Package "Bakehouse Pilot Results" (PDF case study with metrics)
    - Pitch to Oolite, Locust, PAMM departments, university galleries
    - First mover advantage turns into regional network you run

24. **Training & Certification**
    - Onboard interns/residents as certified "Smart Sign Producers"
    - They become advocates—and future operators when you scale to other sites

## 4. COMMUNICATION THEORY APPLICATION

### The Power Equation
**Control of Communication System = Control of:**
- What gets visibility
- Who connects with whom
- What counts as "official" information
- The agenda of the community
- The data about community engagement

### Your Leverage Points
1. **Information Asymmetry**: You hold unique data about what the community cares about
2. **Dependency Creation**: Once people rely on your system, they can't easily switch
3. **Agenda-Setting Power**: You decide what gets featured and how
4. **Network Effects**: More users = more valuable for everyone
5. **Institutional Memory**: You become the archive of community activity

### Risk Mitigation
- **Perception of Bias**: Build in transparency and governance
- **Institutional Pushback**: Frame as shared power, not replacement
- **Burnout Risk**: Automate and create clear tiers
