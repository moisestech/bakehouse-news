### Environment Strategy
- **Development**: Local development with hot reloading
- **Staging**: Pre-production testing environment
- **Production**: Live system with monitoring
- **Preview**: Feature branch deployments

## 🔄 CI/CD Pipeline

### GitHub Actions Workflow
```yaml
name: Deploy to Production
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - Checkout code
      - Install dependencies
      - Run tests
      - Build application

  deploy-staging:
    needs: test
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    if: github.event_name == 'pull_request'
    steps:
      - Deploy to staging environment
      - Run integration tests
      - Generate preview URL

  deploy-production:
    needs: test
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
    steps:
      - Deploy to production
      - Run smoke tests
      - Update monitoring
```
